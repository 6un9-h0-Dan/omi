    Restart OMI (rather than reload) on a reload operation
    
    Currently, when providers install themselves, they tell OMI to 'reload'
    in order for OMI to register those providers. It turns out that, for
    whatever reason, OMI isn't listening properly on our port after a
    'reload' operation.
    
    As a temporary workaround, when OMI is told to reload, actually restart
    the server. This avoids changing many products (Apache, MySQL, SCXcore,
    etc). We'll fix OMI at a later date to reload properly.

    Fix major strand bug
    
    When acks are sent on different threads to protocol requests themselves,
    there was a race condition when two code executions were trying to send
    messages at the same time on a single strand. This change caused the ack
    to be queued for execution when any existing thread on the strand
    unwound.

    Upgrades should work now (hopefully).  You may need to use "--force" on RPM systems if it's the same build number (OMI will always be the same build number, since it doesn't have a build number).
    
         Some curl changes to use the "easy" interface instead of the callback function.
    
         There's now a file at /opt/omi/etc/dsc/dsc.conf that contains three keyvalue pairs.
    
    Some additional changes to fix a crash, and allow for a user to not specify a cipher list (in case their version of curl does not support that option. I encountered this on CentOS 7 with my seemingly broken libcurl. Once I rebuilt and reinstalled it, I never saw that issue again. But this change will prevent a customer from simply not being able to ever use the pull client).
    Made a change so that we start omiserver after the omi package is installed.
    Added support for WMF 5 pull server meta configurations without partial configuration. We should no longer crash here :)

    [CDM] Allow optional disabling of both SSL_v2 and SSL_v3 in OMI IMP. Note that IMP allowed SSL_v2 by default while 2012R2_URNext did not; I continued that behavior but added a flag to disable SSL_v2 as well as SSL_v3

    Removing a space after the "libcurl.so " grep.  This way we'll work with systems that don't have "libcurl.so" registered with ldconfig, but do have "libcurl.so.3" or "libcurl.so.4".  Apparently that's most of them.
    
    Also contains some rearrangement of service manager code.

    This has two changes, one of which is extremely minor:
    
         1. Some of the preuninstall section headers had their numbers increased by a factor of 10, just to make room.  This is the extremely minor change.
         2. The real change for this changeset is in the Linux_RPM.data file.   This makes it so we only call UnconfigurePAM if this not an upgrade on RPM.  The reason we're doing this is because RPM is odd in the way that it upgrades a package.  It first calls the pre and post install scripts of the new package that you're upgrading to, and then the pre and post uninstall of the previous package.  In a situation like this, we do NOT want to call UnconfigurePAM in the preuninstall when we're upgrading because it will remove omi's PAM config file!  We only want to call this function if we're really just flat out uninstalling the omi kit.
    
         This is a bug that arose during the transition to the new installbuilder (the old installbuilder did this properly).

    We were missing two functions: GetCurrentPAMConfig_file and GetCurrentPAMConfig_dir, both of which existed before the new install builder.  These functions are useful to make sure we don't mess up the PAM config on the system if it changes while OMI is installed and then we reinstall.

    After talking to Anurag and Jeff, changing this message from an error to info seems more appropriate.  If you try to stop the server and it isn't running, you shouldn't get an error in the log; INFO level is more appropriate.

    Allow custom PAM configuration file to be used for OMI.
    
    With these changes, I had a custom PAM file to be used with the following commands:

           sudo cp pam.conf /etc/opt/microsoft/omi/conf
    
    Now, during the installation, I saw:
