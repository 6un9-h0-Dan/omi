commit 1568760
Author: Jeff Coffler <jeff@taltos.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 20 17:02:46 2016

    Restart OMI (rather than reload) on a reload operation
    
    Currently, when providers install themselves, they tell OMI to 'reload'
    in order for OMI to register those providers. It turns out that, for
    whatever reason, OMI isn't listening properly on our port after a
    'reload' operation.
    
    As a temporary workaround, when OMI is told to reload, actually restart
    the server. This avoids changing many products (Apache, MySQL, SCXcore,
    etc). We'll fix OMI at a later date to reload properly.

    Fix major strand bug
    
    When acks are sent on different threads to protocol requests themselves,
    there was a race condition when two code executions were trying to send
    messages at the same time on a single strand. This change caused the ack
    to be queued for execution when any existing thread on the strand
    unwound.

    OMI configuration file editor. This is now part of the kit, but is not integrated into installers of OMI (i.e. SCX, CM, ...). That will come next.
    
    Note that this was written in C++, primarily for ease in implementation. Since omireg is written in C++ too (much to my surprise), I did the same here. MUCH faster for implementation that way.

Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Fri May 1 09:19:46 2015

    The person who wrote this comment didn't realize that we'll be leaking both memory and a file handle if we don't call this function here.  Refactoring (as per the comment) is something we should consider in the future, but will work just fine as long as you don't have two MI_Applications open at the same time (DSC doesn't write anything to this log anyway, I believe).

commit c5bdcd5
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Mon Apr 13 08:55:27 2015

    Upgrades should work now (hopefully).  You may need to use "--force" on RPM systems if it's the same build number (OMI will always be the same build number, since it doesn't have a build number).
    
         Some curl changes to use the "easy" interface instead of the callback function.
    
         There's now a file at /opt/omi/etc/dsc/dsc.conf that contains three keyvalue pairs.
    
    Some additional changes to fix a crash, and allow for a user to not specify a cipher list (in case their version of curl does not support that option. I encountered this on CentOS 7 with my seemingly broken libcurl. Once I rebuilt and reinstalled it, I never saw that issue again. But this change will prevent a customer from simply not being able to ever use the pull client).
    Made a change so that we start omiserver after the omi package is installed.
    Added support for WMF 5 pull server meta configurations without partial configuration. We should no longer crash here :)

Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>

    Also contains some rearrangement of service manager code.

commit af610cd
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Wed Oct 15 09:56:10 2014

    This has two changes, one of which is extremely minor:
    
         1. Some of the preuninstall section headers had their numbers increased by a factor of 10, just to make room.  This is the extremely minor change.
         2. The real change for this changeset is in the Linux_RPM.data file.   This makes it so we only call UnconfigurePAM if this not an upgrade on RPM.  The reason we're doing this is because RPM is odd in the way that it upgrades a package.  It first calls the pre and post install scripts of the new package that you're upgrading to, and then the pre and post uninstall of the previous package.  In a situation like this, we do NOT want to call UnconfigurePAM in the preuninstall when we're upgrading because it will remove omi's PAM config file!  We only want to call this function if we're really just flat out uninstalling the omi kit.
    
         This is a bug that arose during the transition to the new installbuilder (the old installbuilder did this properly).

    We were missing two functions: GetCurrentPAMConfig_file and GetCurrentPAMConfig_dir, both of which existed before the new install builder.  These functions are useful to make sure we don't mess up the PAM config on the system if it changes while OMI is installed and then we reinstall.

    After talking to Anurag and Jeff, changing this message from an error to info seems more appropriate.  If you try to stop the server and it isn't running, you shouldn't get an error in the log; INFO level is more appropriate.

    Allow custom PAM configuration file to be used for OMI.
    
    With these changes, I had a custom PAM file to be used with the following commands:
           sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/microsoft/omi/conf
           sudo cp pam.conf /etc/opt/microsoft/omi/conf
    
    Now, during the installation, I saw:
           ~> sudo ~/dev/work/opsmgr/target/Linux_REDHAT_6.1_x64_64_Debug/scx-1.5.1-779.rhel.6.x64.sh --install
           Extracting...

    Note that the custom PAM file was used.  When I looked at /etc/pam.d/omi, it was my file.  Verified with winrm on Windows, authentication worked fine.

    Create SSL linkage by using ldd on openssl binary for the OM, CM, and OMI projects.
    
    Modify dependent projects to depend on script that OMI sets up for creating these links, and modify OMI installer such that it cleans up these links on removal of the OMI package.

Author: Jeff Coffler <REDMOND\jeffcof>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 11:46:03 2014

    Fix up OMI version handling to consistently be 1.0.8-1.  We picked this because it's consistent with other kits (major.minor.patch-release), which is what Kris wanted.
    
    Tested with OM and Apache's shell bundles.  I'll ask JohnK to verify CM, but this should be an easy change there.
