commit d55be80
Author: Paul Allen <paulall@microsoft.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 23 13:07:55 2016

    Host idle registration should only happen once
    
    A refactor for shell hosts broke this and caused it to happen for each
    operation. The idle request is for keeping the host open and when an
    idle message is received from the host it checks to make sure the number
    of requests is just 1, namely the idle request, and if so shuts down the
    host.

commit eb80ada
Author: Paul Allen <paulall@microsoft.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 17 15:21:39 2016

    Shell tags, correlate original tag with response
    
    Make all shell operations have their own dedicated operation message
    tags so it is easier to track the messages. Updated message logging to
    include these (and fix some others). Added original operation message
    tag to the response message so the response can be correlated better
    with the request. Cleaned up the shell status in the agent manager based
    on if the operations actually succeed or not for connect/reconnect.

commit dbec96f
Author: Paul Allen <paulall@microsoft.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 8 10:13:29 2016

    Support shell Connect message
    
    For a shell is disconnected a new client will need to reestablish
    client-side state in much the same was as an initial CreateShell would.
    This change implements this new Connect message and propagates the shell
    request through to the provider. Connect has a strange interaction with
    the shell process such that we need to special case the response to
    include an xml element as is rather than crafting it ourselves.

    Support for selectorFilter, shell enumeration
    
    Added support for selectorFilter to enumerateInstances through to the
    provider, although currently no way of passing it to the provider.
    Initial support for shell enumeration such that a hard-coded shell is
    returned. More work is needed to fully support this though as each shell
    is then subsequently queried to enumerate commands which is not
    supported throughout yet.

commit 43ebb45
Author: Jeff Coffler <jeff@taltos.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 20 17:02:46 2016

    Restart OMI (rather than reload) on a reload operation
    
    Currently, when providers install themselves, they tell OMI to 'reload'
    in order for OMI to register those providers. It turns out that, for
    whatever reason, OMI isn't listening properly on our port after a
    'reload' operation.
    
    As a temporary workaround, when OMI is told to reload, actually restart
    the server. This avoids changing many products (Apache, MySQL, SCXcore,
    etc). We'll fix OMI at a later date to reload properly.

    When acks are sent on different threads to protocol requests themselves,

    to be queued for execution when any existing thread on the strand
    unwound.

    Add build support to SCX for Ubuntu 14

commit e0b3fae
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Thu Jul 9 14:57:10 2015

    This is an algorithmically equivalent port of Nic's changeset (431664).  This will generate a localhost self signed certificate if certificate generation  with the normal hostname/longhostname fails (which it does if the hostname is longer than 64 characters on some Linux platforms.)

commit b9312c8
Author: Jeff Coffler <REDMOND\jeffcof>
Date:   Wed Jun 3 16:41:45 2015

    [CDM] OMI should disable SSLv2 by default, and allow it to be enabled. SSLv3 should have identical behavior, but is explicitly set to NoSSLv3=false in configuration file, at least until Windows disables it.

commit a070c35
Author: Jeff Coffler <REDMOND\jeffcof>
Date:   Thu May 28 14:17:19 2015

    OMI configuration file editor. This is now part of the kit, but is not integrated into installers of OMI (i.e. SCX, CM, ...). That will come next.
    
    Note that this was written in C++, primarily for ease in implementation. Since omireg is written in C++ too (much to my surprise), I did the same here. MUCH faster for implementation that way.

Date:   Fri May 1 09:21:47 2015

    Temporary rollback of this changeset.  Will be adding this back in once we have a good build generic OMI.

commit 693a93e
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Fri May 1 09:19:46 2015

    The person who wrote this comment didn't realize that we'll be leaking both memory and a file handle if we don't call this function here.  Refactoring (as per the comment) is something we should consider in the future, but will work just fine as long as you don't have two MI_Applications open at the same time (DSC doesn't write anything to this log anyway, I believe).

commit 78e15cf
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Wed Apr 15 10:31:45 2015

     1. adds lots of log messages for the pull client
         2. reverts a change to oiomi.h that I accidentally made awhile back
         3. Fixes the init script for omiserver
         4. regenerated schema (this fixes the Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager issue we encountered)
         5. Unified the MSFT_DSCMetaConfiguration mofs

commit 6bd0e23
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Mon Apr 13 08:55:27 2015

    Upgrades should work now (hopefully).  You may need to use "--force" on RPM systems if it's the same build number (OMI will always be the same build number, since it doesn't have a build number).
    
         Some curl changes to use the "easy" interface instead of the callback function.
    
         There's now a file at /opt/omi/etc/dsc/dsc.conf that contains three keyvalue pairs.
    
    Some additional changes to fix a crash, and allow for a user to not specify a cipher list (in case their version of curl does not support that option. I encountered this on CentOS 7 with my seemingly broken libcurl. Once I rebuilt and reinstalled it, I never saw that issue again. But this change will prevent a customer from simply not being able to ever use the pull client).
    Made a change so that we start omiserver after the omi package is installed.
    Added support for WMF 5 pull server meta configurations without partial configuration. We should no longer crash here :)

commit 2ba7679
Author: Jeff Coffler <REDMOND\jeffcof>
Date:   Fri Apr 10 13:29:04 2015

    [CDM] Allow optional disabling of both SSL_v2 and SSL_v3 in OMI IMP. Note that IMP allowed SSL_v2 by default while 2012R2_URNext did not; I continued that behavior but added a flag to disable SSL_v2 as well as SSL_v3

commit 84c08b4
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Wed Apr 8 10:42:34 2015

    Removing a space after the "libcurl.so " grep.  This way we'll work with systems that don't have "libcurl.so" registered with ldconfig, but do have "libcurl.so.3" or "libcurl.so.4".  Apparently that's most of them.
    
    Also contains some rearrangement of service manager code.

commit be58c13
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Tue Mar 31 10:45:47 2015

         4 small fixes for DSC:
    
         1. MI_EXTERN_C removed due to the bug with provider generation
         2. Added check for ctypes module
         3. Added architecture at end of rpm/deb filename
         4. Renaming omi file to match the package name (omiserver)

Author: Nicolas Roy <REDMOND\niroy>
Date:   Wed Mar 25 18:31:37 2015

    Fix hostname being overwritten on certain UNIX systems. On certain Unix systems like HP, "hostname -f" does not return the FQDN but sets the hostname to "-f". This causes failures later on. This bug is only revealed when installing OMI.

    Fix looping problem in omiagent (omiagent can consume all idle resources at times). This was observed on a test system that Anurag was running, but it's not clear how to replicate this at will.

commit 21878ae
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Wed Oct 15 09:56:10 2014

    This has two changes, one of which is extremely minor:
    
         1. Some of the preuninstall section headers had their numbers increased by a factor of 10, just to make room.  This is the extremely minor change.
         2. The real change for this changeset is in the Linux_RPM.data file.   This makes it so we only call UnconfigurePAM if this not an upgrade on RPM.  The reason we're doing this is because RPM is odd in the way that it upgrades a package.  It first calls the pre and post install scripts of the new package that you're upgrading to, and then the pre and post uninstall of the previous package.  In a situation like this, we do NOT want to call UnconfigurePAM in the preuninstall when we're upgrading because it will remove omi's PAM config file!  We only want to call this function if we're really just flat out uninstalling the omi kit.
    
         This is a bug that arose during the transition to the new installbuilder (the old installbuilder did this properly).

Date:   Fri Oct 3 10:55:30 2014

    Bringing over changes to omireg from URNext so that we don't realloc possibly hundreds of times when reading the shared library.

commit 9374120
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Fri Oct 3 10:53:40 2014

    We were missing two functions: GetCurrentPAMConfig_file and GetCurrentPAMConfig_dir, both of which existed before the new install builder.  These functions are useful to make sure we don't mess up the PAM config on the system if it changes while OMI is installed and then we reinstall.

commit 595956e
Author: John Kordich <REDMOND\johnkord>
Date:   Thu Oct 2 09:52:28 2014

    After talking to Anurag and Jeff, changing this message from an error to info seems more appropriate.  If you try to stop the server and it isn't running, you shouldn't get an error in the log; INFO level is more appropriate.

    [CDM]
    Allow custom PAM configuration file to be used for OMI.
    
    With these changes, I had a custom PAM file to be used with the following commands:
           sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/microsoft/omi/conf
           sudo cp pam.conf /etc/opt/microsoft/omi/conf
    
    Now, during the installation, I saw:
           ~> sudo ~/dev/work/opsmgr/target/Linux_REDHAT_6.1_x64_64_Debug/scx-1.5.1-779.rhel.6.x64.sh --install

    Note that the custom PAM file was used.  When I looked at /etc/pam.d/omi, it was my file.  Verified with winrm on Windows, authentication worked fine.

    For OMI 1.0.8, installbuilder is stored under the UNIX directory.

Author: Jeff Coffler <REDMOND\jeffcof>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 11:46:03 2014

    Fix up OMI version handling to consistently be 1.0.8-1.  We picked this because it's consistent with other kits (major.minor.patch-release), which is what Kris wanted.
    
    Tested with OM and Apache's shell bundles.  I'll ask JohnK to verify CM, but this should be an easy change there.

    There were two bugs with SSL Cipher Suites,
